<h2>JSON API</h2>

<h2>Fraud Intelligence Enterprise</h2>
<p>Transaction Risk Analysis (TRA) and Low Value Payment (LVP) exemptions can now be automated. 
Risk appetite, velocity checks and other criteria can be defined as conditions. 
The exemptions are then automatically requested if applicable for the current transaction and all other specified conditions are met.</p>

<p>Transactions checked by Fraud Intelligence now also show the calculated risk score and Fraud Intelligence Insights in the Backoffice transaction detail views.</p>

<h2>Additional Risk Management details</h2>
<p>A new BlockReason field is added to JSON API responses if the transaction was blocked by the Saferpay Risk Management. 
The BlockReason tells whether the transaction was blocked due to IP address, IP location, issuer country or card blacklist entries.</p>

<h2>Exemption details shown in Backoffice</h2>
<p>The transaction details in the Transaction Journal and Declined Journal now show if a Transaction Risk Analysis (TRA) or Low Value Payment (LVP) exemption was requested.</p>

<h2>Payment initiator for direct authorizations</h2>
<p>A new Initiator field in Transaction/AuthorizeDirect requests can be used to indicate whether the transaction was initiated by the merchant (default) or by the payer.</p>

<h2>Issuer reference for SAQ-A EP certified merchants</h2>
<p>The response of every successful authorization now contains an IssuerReference with a TransactionStamp and in case of a Mastercard transaction, a SettlementDate. 
The TransactionStamp and SettlementDate can be used to reference the authorization even if it was made by a business partner or via another PSP.</p>
<p>To reference an existing authorization, the IssuerReference can be passed on in Transaction/AuthorizeDirect requests.</p>

<h2>New Feature: Create Saferpay Fields Access Tokens via API</h2>
<p>Saferpay Fields Access Tokens can now be created by calling SaferpayFields ApiKeys in the Saferpay Management API.</p>

<h2>Consolidated Event List with Declined Reservations</h2>

<section id="2021-01">
<h1><a name="Release 2021-01"></a>Release 2021-01</h1>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

<div class="info">
<p><strong>Release Date: 2021-01-19</strong><br/>Available on Sandbox: 2021-01-05</p>
</div>
<h2>JSON API</h2>
No changes.

<h2>3-D Secure 2.2</h2>
<p>Saferpay upgraded to the latest 3-D Secure version 2.2 for Visa Secure, Mastercard ID Check and American Express Safekey.</p>

<h2>Soft Decline Handling</h2>

<p>With the beginning of 2021, important PSD2 deadlines became active, forcing issuers to respond with a so called Soft Decline to certain not fully authenticated authorizations.</p>

<div class="warning">It is highly recommended for every merchant in PSD2 scope to implement proper handling of Soft Declines.</div>
<br/>
<p>In case of a Soft Decline, the merchant needs to contact the payer so he can initiate another authorization with SCA.
In case of <a href="https://saferpay.github.io/sndbx/recurring.html">Recurring Payments</a>, a new initial transaction has to be made or a new Alias with SCA and a forced challenge flow need to be created.
<br/>
For details on how to handle Soft Declines, please refer to the <a href="https://saferpay.github.io/sndbx/psd2.html#psd2-decline">Saferpay Integration Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>MIT and Alias Handling</h2>
<p>All Aliases registered after the January release will have a SCA Transaction Stamp which is sent in subsequent transactions using this Alias. This means that newly registered Aliases might have a better approval rate compared to the old ones which don't have a SCA Transaction Stamp.</p>

<h2>Klarna Payments: Support for multi-part capture and refunds</h2>
<p>Multi-part captures and refunds are now available for Klarna Payments through the API and the Saferpay Backoffice. This allows you to partially capture an order to send and bill it in separate parts.</p>

<h2>Extended Omni-Channel capabilities</h2>
<p>Saferpay is now connected to Worldine's omni-channel platform. This allows merchants to track transactions from Saferpay and other solutions combined in one portal.</p>

The terminal used for the alias payment must have the brand activated which was used in the authorization.
</div>

<h2>New Feature: Partial Approval (amount-reduced authorization)</h2>
